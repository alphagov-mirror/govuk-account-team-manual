    The `suspend` and `resume` jobs are at the start of the deploy pipeline. These jobs affect both the staging and production environments.

1. Select __suspend__ to go to the suspend job screen.

1. Select the icon in the top right of the screen to start the job and trigger the build. The suspend job:

    - maps the GOV.UK Accounts URL to the [GOV.UK Accounts static error page](https://govuk-account-static-errors.london.cloudapps.digital/)
    - unmaps the GOV.UK Accounts app from the GOV.UK Accounts URL
