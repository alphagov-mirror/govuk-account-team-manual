# Set up the GOV.UK account manager prototype

The GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store are a central part of GOV.UK Accounts.
You can find out more about how they work with other services in [How GOV.UK Accounts works](/new-starter/how-it-works/#how-gov-uk-accounts-works).

This content tells you how to:

- set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store locally
- integrate the `finder-frontend` Brexit checker with the GOV.UK account manager and attribute store

This content is for GOV.UK developers working on Macs or Linux. If you are not a GOV.UK developer, you cannot use this prototype.

## Install GOV.UK Docker

[Install GOV.UK Docker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md). Make sure that you allocate at least the minimum resources specified in the [GOV.UK Docker settings guidance](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md#docker-settings) as running the prototype on your local machine is resource-intensive.

## Clone repositories to local machine

To set up GOV.UK account manager, clone the following repositories (repos) to the `~/govuk` folder on your local machine:

- the [GOV.UK account manager prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-account-manager-prototype)
- the [GOV.UK attribute service prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-attribute-service-prototype)
- the [finder frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend) that contains the Brexit checker
- the [email alert API](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/)

You [create the `~/govuk` folder](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/#installation) when you install GOV.UK Docker.

Check out the following branches on the different repos:

- `master` branch on the GOV.UK Docker repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK account manager prototype repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK attribute service prototype repo
- `master` branch on the Brexit checker repo

## Set up the docker image and database

In the command line, go to the `govuk/govuk-docker` repo folder and run the following commands:

- `make govuk-attribute-service-prototype`
- `make govuk-account-manager-prototype`
- `make finder-frontend`
- `make email-alert-api`

These commands set up a docker image, build the required system and gem dependencies, and set up the database.

## Prevent developers from deploying secrets

The Account Manager prototype uses the [Pre-Commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) and the [`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) plugin to prevent developers deploying secrets.

### Install Pre-Commit framework

If you are using the [Homebrew Package Manager](https://brew.sh/) or [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) on Mac, install Pre-Commit by running `brew install pre-commit` in the command line.

See [the Pre-Commit framework installation documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) for more instructions on how to install Pre-Commit.

You must have Python 3 installed for this to work. Running the `brew install` command will install Python 3 as well. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for other ways to install Python 3 if required.

### Install `detect-secrets`

The `detect-secrets` plugin to the Pre-Commit framework detects secrets within a codebase.

To alert developers when they attempt to enter a secret in the codebase, [install the client-side pre-commit hook](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets#client-side-pre-commit-hook).

## Start the account manager prototype without the Brexit checker

You can start the account manager prototype without the checker.

You can run every feature of the prototype locally, however the registration journey will not transfer data from the checker.
The account will also be empty of user data.

To start this with govuk docker:

In the command line, run `govuk-docker up govuk-account-manager-prototype-app`. Running this command starts:
- `govuk-account-manager-prototype`
- `govuk-attribute-service-prototype`
- background services required for these apps to work

This command also configures the 2 applications so that they communicate with each other.

Open up a web browser and go to `http://www.login.service.dev.gov.uk/sign-in`.

If you have set up the apps correctly, you will be able to register a new account, or sign in if you have already created one.

## Start the Brexit checker and account manager prototype apps

To register a new GOV.UK account most users arrive through the checker.
Without data from the checker, the user's dashboard will not show any integrations with GOV.UK services.

You can spin up all apps required to follow the full user registration journey with govuk-docker.

In the command line, run `govuk-docker up finder-frontend-app-account`. Running this command starts:

- `finder-frontend`, which contains the checker
- `govuk-account-manager-prototype`
- `govuk-attribute-service-prototype`
- background services required for these apps to work

This command also configures these apps so that they can communicate with each other.

Open up a web browser and go to `https://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk`.

If you have set up the apps correctly, you will be able to access the following links:

- the [Brexit checker journey start page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/questions)
- the [Brexit checker results page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/results?c[]=living-ie) that reflects the answers you give during the Brexit checker journey
- select the subscribe banner or button to access the [account sign up page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/save-your-results?c%5B%5D=living-ie)

When you have set up your local account, you can [sign into your account](http://www.login.service.dev.gov.uk/) and view the manage screens.

You have now set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype, and integrated the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker with the GOV.UK account manager.
