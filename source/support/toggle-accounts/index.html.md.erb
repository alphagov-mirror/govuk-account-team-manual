#  Suspend and resume GOV.UK Account

You can suspend and resume GOV.UK Account. When you suspend GOV.UK Account, the following happens with immediate effect:

- new users are not be able to sign up for GOV.UK Account
- users can no longer access their accounts or the data stored in their accounts
- users attempting to access their accounts are redirected to an error page

## Deciding to suspend GOV.UK Account

You may need to suspend GOV.UK Account because of a:

- security incident or data leak
- major breaking bug
- request from the senior management team (SMT)
- planned maintenance period

## Before you start

To suspend or resume GOV.UK Account, you must be a GDS GOV.UK programme developer with:

- access to the GDS VPN
- a [GDS GitHub account](https://github.com/alphagov/)
- access to the GOV.UK Account production environment through your GDS GitHub account

## Suspend GOV.UK Account

1. Sign in to the GDS VPN using the command line or the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.

1. Sign in to [GDS Concourse homepage](https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering) using your GDS GitHub account credentials.

    On the left hand side of the page, you will see a list of Concourse pipelines called __all pipelines__. Pipelines in this list are grouped under headings.

1. Select the __govuk-tools__ group and then select the [__govuk-account-manager-prototype__ pipeline](https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering/teams/govuk-tools/pipelines/govuk-account-manager-prototype).

    You can now see the deploy pipeline for the GOV.UK Account Manager prototype.

    There are 4 suspend and resume jobs at the start of the deploy pipeline:
    - suspend_staging
    - suspend_production
    - resume_staging
    - resume_production

    You can suspend the staging and production environments independently. For example, you can suspend staging as a test before suspending production.

1. Select __suspend_staging__ or __suspend_production__ to go to the suspend job screen.

1. Select the __Trigger Build__ icon in the top right corner of the screen to start the job and trigger the build. The suspend job:
    - checks the `git-main` branch for the latest changes to the [Account Manager prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-account-manager-prototype)
    - maps the GOV.UK Account URL to the [GOV.UK Account static error page](https://govuk-account-static-errors.london.cloudapps.digital/)
    - unmaps the GOV.UK Account app from the GOV.UK Account URL
    - maps the attribute store URL to the GOV.UK Account static error page
    - unmaps the attribute store app from the attribute store URL

    If the suspend job completes successfully, the top banner will turn green.
