# Export registration statistics

You can produce reports with information about the number of registrations, logins and other metrics.

To do this you manually run a rake task in the production environment.

For example, run the following to produce statistics for the 28 October 2020:

```
cf login -u <your_email> -a https://api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
cf target -s production
cf v3-ssh govuk-account-manager
$ /tmp/lifecycle/shell
$ rake "statistics:general[2020-10-28 00:00, 2020-10-28 23
```
