# GOV.UK Account team manual

GOV.UK Account is a centralised account infrastructure for GOV.UK. It gives GOV.UK users continuity across their different interactions with the government.

Use this team manual if you are a member of the GOV.UK Account team and need to find out information on internal GOV.UK Account team processes such as handling Zendesk tickets or deploying a branch to the staging environment.

[Contact the GOV.UK Account team](https://www.account.publishing.service.gov.uk/feedback) if you have any questions or feedback.

If you are not a member of the GOV.UK Account team and want to find out about integrating your service with GOV.UK Account, see the [GOV.UK Account technical documentation](https://docs.account.publishing.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-accounts-technical-documentation) for more information.
