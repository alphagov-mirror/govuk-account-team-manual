# Disable registrations

You can disable registrations in the GOV.UK account manager prototype.

You can do this in either the production or the staging environment by changing the concourse pipeline.

1. Open the `concourse/pipeline.yml` in the appropriate environment. IS THIS TRUE? WHERE IS THE ENV VAR?
1. Change `ENABLE_REGISTRATION` environment variable from `true` to `false`.

When you push your change to the main branch, the pipeline change and application are deployed automatically.

If you cannot change the pipeline (for example if you are doing this out of hours), you can use the GOV.UK PaaS CLI to set the environment variable.

1. Sign into the PaaS.
1. Run the following in the command line to set the environment variable to `false`:

    ```
    cf set-env govuk-account-manager ENABLE_REGISTRATION false
    ```
1. Restage the GOV.UK account manager prototype app:

    ```
    cf restage govuk-account-manager
    ```

This approach will cause some brief downtime as the app restarts, and the environment variable change will be lost on the next Concourse deployment.
