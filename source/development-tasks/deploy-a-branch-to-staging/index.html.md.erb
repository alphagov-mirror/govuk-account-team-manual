# Deploy a branch to staging

When making large changes it can be useful to deploy a branch to staging:

- so non-developers can see and interact with the apps
- to test integrations with other systems

## Deploy a branch from GitHub

If the branch you want to deploy is on GitHub, use the existing Concourse pipeline to continuously deploy that branch to staging.

1. Sign in to Concourse:

    ```
    fly login -t cd-govuk-tools -c https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering -n govuk-tools
    ```

2. Disable deployments to production:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools pause-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/deploy-app-production
    ```

3. Disable automatic pipeline updates:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools pause-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/update-pipeline
    ```

4. Edit `concourse/pipeline.yml` and fill in the name of your branch for the `git-main` resource.

5. Deploy your pipeline change:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools set-pipeline -p govuk-account-manager-prototype -c concourse/pipeline.yml
    ```

6. Wait for Concourse to test and deploy your branch.

To revert this change:

1. Enable automatic pipeline updates:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools unpause-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/update-pipeline
    ```

2. Trigger a pipeline update and wait for it to complete:

    ```
    fly --target cd-govuk-tools trigger-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/update-pipeline --watch
    ```

3. Enable deployments to production:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools unpause-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/deploy-app-production
    ```


## Deploy a branch from your machine

If the branch you want to deploy is on your machine instead of GitHub, you can deploy that branch with the CloudFoundry CLI.

1. Sign in to Concourse:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools login
    ```

2. Disable deployments to staging:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools pause-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/deploy-app-staging
    ```

3. Sign in to staging.

    If you are already signed in to CloudFoundry:

    ```
    cf target -s staging
    ```

    If you are not already signed in to CloudFoundry:

    ```
    cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso -o govuk-accounts -s staging
    ```

4. Push your branch to staging:

    ```
    git checkout <branch-name>
    cf push
    ```

This is not a rolling deployment, so it may trigger some failures as app instances restart.

To revert this change:

1. Enable deployments to staging:

    ```
    fly -t cd-govuk-tools unpause-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/deploy-app-staging
    ```

2. Trigger a deployment:

    ```
    fly --target cd-govuk-tools trigger-job --job govuk-account-manager-prototype/deploy-app-staging
    ```

    There is no need to wait for this to complete, as there is no risk of the branch being deployed to production.
