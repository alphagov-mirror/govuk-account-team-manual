# Set up the GOV.UK account manager prototype

The GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store are a central part of GOV.UK Accounts.
You can find out more about how they work with other services in [How GOV.UK Accounts works](/new-starter/how-it-works/#how-gov-uk-accounts-works).

This content tells you how to:

- set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store locally
- integrate the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker with the GOV.UK account manager and attribute store

This content is for GOV.UK developers working on Macs or Linux. If you are not a GOV.UK developer, you cannot use this prototype.

## Install GOV.UK Docker

[Install GOV.UK Docker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md). Make sure that you allocate at least the minimum resources specified in the [GOV.UK Docker settings guidance](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md#docker-settings) as running the prototype on your local machine is resource-intensive.

## Clone repositories to local machine

To set up GOV.UK account manager, clone the following repositories (repos) to the `~/govuk` folder on your local machine:

- the [GOV.UK account manager prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-account-manager-prototype)
- the [GOV.UK attribute service prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-attribute-service-prototype)
- the [finder frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend) that contains the Brexit transition checker
- the [email alert API](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/)

You [create the `~/govuk` folder](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/#installation) when you install GOV.UK Docker.

Check out the following branches on the different repos:

- `master` branch on the GOV.UK Docker repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK account manager prototype repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK attribute service prototype repo
- `master` branch on the Brexit transition checker repo

## Set up the docker image and database

In the command line, go to the `govuk/govuk-docker` repo folder and run the following commands:

- `make govuk-attribute-service-prototype`
- `make govuk-account-manager-prototype`
- `make finder-frontend`
- `make email-alert-api`

These commands set up a docker image, build the required system and gem dependencies, and set up the database.

## Prevent developers from deploying secrets

The Account Manager prototype uses the [Pre-Commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/) and the [`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) plugin to prevent developers deploying secrets.

### Install Pre-Commit framework

If you are using the [Homebrew Package Manager](https://brew.sh/) or [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) on Mac, install Pre-Commit by running `brew install pre-commit` in the command line.

See [the Pre-Commit framework installation documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) for more instructions on how to install Pre-Commit.

You must have Python 3 installed for this to work. Running the `brew install` command will install Python 3 as well. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for other ways to install Python 3 if required.

### Install `detect-secrets`

The `detect-secrets` plugin to the Pre-Commit framework detects secrets within a codebase.

To alert developers when they attempt to enter a secret in the codebase, [install the client-side pre-commit hook](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets#client-side-pre-commit-hook).

## Start the Brexit transition checker and account manager prototype apps

In the command line, go to the `finder-frontend` repo folder and run `govuk-docker-up`. This starts the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker and its dependencies.

Open up a web browser and go to `https://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk`.

If you have set up the apps correctly, you will be able to access the following links:

- the [Brexit transition checker journey start page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/questions)
- the [Brexit transition checker results page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/results?c[]=living-ie) that reflects the answers you give during the Brexit transition checker journey
- select the subscribe banner or button to access the [account sign up page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/save-your-results?c%5B%5D=living-ie)

When you have set up your local account, you can [sign into your account](http://www.login.service.dev.gov.uk/) and view the manage screens.

You have now set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype, and integrated the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker with the GOV.UK account manager.
